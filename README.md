# File Read & Write + Error Handling Program 

## Description

This Python program performs two main tasks:

1. **File Read & Write**:  
   - Prompts the user to enter the name of a file.
   - Reads the content of the file.
   - Converts the content to uppercase.
   - Saves the modified content in a new file prefixed with `modified_`.

2. **Error Handling**:  
   - Handles cases where the file is not found or cannot be read.
   - Provides error message for a better user experience.
   - Ensures the program completes gracefully.
